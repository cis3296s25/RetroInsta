# RetroInsta - A Day One Instagram Clone
RetroInsta aims to replicate Instagram's initial feature set. Users can log in with their Google Accounts, post a photo with a filter applied, like other user's posts, follow other accounts, see a feed of posts they follow, and see an explore page which features popular posts site-wide.

## How to build and run   
- Install Docker. The easiest way is to install [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/).
- Open Docker Desktop to ensure the Docker daemon/engine is running or do so [manually](https://docs.docker.com/engine/daemon/start/).
- Run the following command from the project's root directory (`RetroInsta` by default) to build a Docker image and start it in a container: `docker compose up`.
- Go to http://localhost:5173 to view the website.
